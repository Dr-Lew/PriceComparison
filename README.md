<h1>Price Comparator</h1>
This application will allow a user to make a grocery list and inform the user which store has the 
cheapest price for each product in the user's grocery list. In order to accomplish this the user will provide 
a set of stores they shop at and a list of products they want to buy. Using the provided
list of stores, the application will find which stores have the cheapest price for
each of the products.

<h2>Code Milestone 1 Release Notes</h2>

Milestone one is focused on getting the zipcode from the user and displaying the
Target stores in the given zip code. The user then selects which stores they would 
like to shop at. Once the user has confirmed their stores, the application finds the 
store that has the cheapest price for a test product (in this case a 12 pack of coca-cola).
We have accomplished what we wanted to accomplish for milestone 1. The only difference is
that we went with Target instead of Walmart due to difficulties with the Walmart API.
