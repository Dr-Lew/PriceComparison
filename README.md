<h1>Price Comparator</h1>
This application will allow a user to make a grocery list and inform the user which store has the 
cheapest price for each product in the user's grocery list. In order to accomplish this the user will provide 
a set of stores they shop at and a list of products they want to buy. Using the provided
list of stores, the application will find which stores have the cheapest price for
each of the products.

<h2>Code Milestone 1 Release Notes</h2>

Milestone one is focused on getting the zipcode from the user and displaying the
Target stores in the given zip code. The user then selects which stores they would 
like to shop at. Once the user has confirmed their stores, the application finds the 
store that has the cheapest price for a test product (in this case a 12 pack of coca-cola).
We have accomplished what we wanted to accomplish for milestone 1. The only difference is
that we went with Target instead of Walmart due to difficulties with the Walmart API.

<h2>Code Milestone 2 Release Notes</h2>

Milestone two is focused on connecting User Interface with API of grocery stores. Our
UI has test products with images, which the user could choose from the list of products directly 
or use a search button. That should help to navigate an user to the correct item quicker. Our web app
includes a shopping list. Our user could press "Add" button and you could see the name of the
product and quantity of them.

<h2>Code Milestone 3 Notes</h2>
Milestone three is focused on bringing the project completely together by adding a page that displays the contents of the user's shopping cart and 
finding the cheapest price and where to buy each item. A database was also implemented that holds the products. The shopping list page of our application was updated to
to display the items in the database and functionality for displaying only certain categories was also implemented to help the user find the product they need. 

<h2>Code Milestone 4 Notes</h2>
Milestone 4 is focused on wrapping the project up. Specifically, styling was applied to clean up the front end. The Walmart API was also integrated to support Walmart stores. Finally the shopping cart page was updated to display the total of the cart as well as the store to shop at to save the most money. This milestone concludes our project. The user can select a zip code and stores they shop at, make a shopping cart of products, and find where to buy each product.
