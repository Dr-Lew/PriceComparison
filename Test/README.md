Code Milestone 1 Release Note

<br>
<br>

Milestone one is focused on getting the zipcode from the user and displaying the
Target stores in the given zip code. The user then selects which stores they would 
like to shop at. Once the user has confirmed their stores, the application finds the 
store that has the cheapest price for a test product (in this case a 12 pack of coca-cola).
We have accomplished what we wanted to accomplish for milestone 1. The only difference is
that we went with Target instead of Walmart due to difficulties with the Walmart API.
